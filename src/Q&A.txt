INTERVIEW Q&A: Navigation Tag and Lazy Loading
===============================================

1. NAVIGATION TAG (<nav>)
--------------------------

Q: Why do we use <nav> tag instead of <div> for navigation?

A: 
- Semantic HTML: Makes code more meaningful and readable
- Accessibility: Screen readers can identify and navigate to it easily
- SEO: Search engines understand the page structure better
- Best Practice: Follows web standards for better maintainability

Note: A <div> works the same functionally, but <nav> provides semantic meaning.


2. LAZY LOADING WITH SUSPENSE
------------------------------

Q: Why do we use lazy loading with Suspense in React?

A:
- Smaller Bundle: Only loads the current route's code, not all routes
- Faster Load: Initial page loads faster, especially on slow connections
- Code Splitting: Each route becomes a separate chunk loaded on demand
- Better Performance: Reduces memory usage and improves runtime performance
- Better UX: Suspense shows loading state while component loads

Q: How does lazy loading work?

A:
1. Use React.lazy() to dynamically import components
2. Wrap routes in Suspense with a fallback UI
3. Component loads only when route is accessed
4. Shows fallback while loading, then renders the component

Example:
const TodoPage = lazy(() => import('@/pages/01_Todo'));

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <Route path="/todo" element={<TodoPage />} />
</Suspense>

Q: When should we use lazy loading?

A:
- For route-based components
- When you have many pages/components
- To improve initial load performance
- When components are not needed immediately
